      <h3>About The Freelancer</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, I have a great deal of experience in writing business plans in
        many business sectors and for many different types of organizations. My
        unique feature, as well as my business knowledge, forecast, and
        financial projection ability, is my award-winning marketing status. This
        means that all of my business plans are very practically focused and
        detail exactly what needs doing, how and when, to make the whole plan a
        success. After working as a content writer for over a decade, I've
        learned a few things about what makes a truly great story. Passion for
        your tale is important, but so are all the subtle nuances to language
        and story telling that make a truly compelling read. That's where I come
        in. I'll take your innovative ideas and bring them to life in a way that
        captures the minds of readers. Through regular, consistent
        communication, we can work together to create the story you've always
        envisioned.
